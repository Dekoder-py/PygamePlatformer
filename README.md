# Unnamed 2D Platformer

I'll come up with a name later :)

Written in python with pygame-ce.

Created following [Clear Code's Tutorial](https://youtu.be/WViyCAa6yLI)

I got the assets from Clear

## Running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dekoder-py/PygamePlatformer
cd PygamePlatformer
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m code.main
```
